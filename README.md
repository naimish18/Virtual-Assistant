# Virtual-Assistant

Installition:
We provided with 2 ways to install the app.

By installing the installer from the releases
By running the script
We recommend using the installer if you don't have python properly installed in your machine. https://github.com/FirePlank/Student-Portal/releases

However, if you want to run the scripts, then you must have python and git properly installed in your machine. Then use these 5 simple commands to run the app.

git clone https://github.com/naimish18/Virtual-Assistant.git # it clones the repository in your machine

cd Virtual-Assistant # Change your working directory

pip install -r requirements.txt # Install all the dependencies, might take time depending on your internet speed

python main.py # Run the app
